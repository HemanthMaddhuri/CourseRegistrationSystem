# CourseRegistrationSystem

This is a Python project named Course Registration System and I have used Django Framework, Python, Bootstrap, HTML to build this project
* The /course/add page is used to add a course by Student.
* The /course/list page shows the course list and details added by Student to the admin/faculty.
* Now we have additional options in the course list page as Add, Drop, Delete.
* Add button in course list page is used to add the Student to section which reduces the openseat capacity by 1.
* Similarly, when Drop button is clicked the Student is dropped from the course and openseat capacity is increased by 1.
* Delete is used to delete the course for that Student incase of wrong assignment.
